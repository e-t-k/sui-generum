What this is for:
Making 2 files:
expression.tsv
metadata.tsv

expression contains x+1 columns : x samples and 1 gene names
metadata contains 13 columns total of stuff, and 1 row per sample (x rows total)
we have to aggregate two different metadata tsvs to form the result
and we also have to make sure the result contains EXACTLY the samples that the expression contains.

So - if expression doesn't mention a sample that the metadata does -- remove the METADATA sample.
If expression does mention a sample that metadata doesn't -- add an empty METADATA line for that sample.

So this script does it.
See the python for the inputs and outputs file names -- just run everything from current working dir.

python needs the list of samples from the expression -- you can use the bash script to pull them out.
